you can use Git and Robot Framework together to test the application automatically after every update of the source code
Store your code in a Git repository: Let's say you have a Flask web application in a file named "app.py". You store this code in a Git repository on a remote server like GitHub.

Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) system: In this example, let's use Travis CI as the CI system. You can sign up for an account on the Travis CI website and set up a new repository in Travis CI that is linked to your GitHub repository.

Configure the CI system to run the tests: In Travis CI, you create a ".travis.yml" file that defines the steps that Travis CI should follow to build and test your code. The file should contain the following steps:language: python
python:
  - "3.8"

install:
  - pip install flask
  - pip install robotframework
  - pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary

script:
  - robot test.robot
  Write test cases: You write the test cases using the Robot Framework syntax in a file named "test.robot". The file should contain the following test cases:
  
  *** Settings ***
Library           SeleniumLibrary

*** Test Cases ***
Test Case 1
    Open Browser    http://localhost:5000    chrome
    Title Should Be    Flask Web Application
    Close Browser
    
Push code changes to the repository: When you make changes to your Flask web application and push the changes to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will automatically detect the changes and start the build process.

The CI system runs the tests: Travis CI will clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the tests using the Robot Framework. If all the tests pass, the code changes are considered to be validated. If any tests fail, you will receive notifications and can debug the code and improve it.

This is a simple example that shows how you can use Git, a CI system (Travis CI), and the Robot Framework to automate the testing of a Flask web application.
